# webscore

This directory contains the source code for webscore, a tool that takes in
input a OONI report containing Web Connectivity measurements and emits in
output the score of such measurement according to OONI Probe Engine.

We use this tool to process old measurements and verify what is the score
that OONI Probe Engine would have applied to such measurement.
